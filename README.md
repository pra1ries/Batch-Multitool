# Batch-Multitool
A small multitool created in batch.



NOTE:

Certain functions *WILL NOT WORK* in the "Downloads" folder, please move the file to a different folder once it is downloaded (i.e. Desktop)


This multitool is written entirely in batch, meaning no extra installations are required for installation on Windows.

# How do I use this?
When you launch the program, you will see several different commands. Each one is listed with a number next to it. Type the number of the selected command and press enter to run it. Make sure to make an issue on the issues page if you have trouble with this.

# Installation
1.) Go to https://github.com/CorbinMakesStuff/Batch-Multitool/releases/latest and install "corbinsmultitool.bat"

2.) Dismiss Windows Smartscreen warning. This happens because the file is not commonly downloaded and the program is not signed.

3.) Run the file.

4.) Dismiss Windows Smartscreen again.

5.) Done!

This guide will be updates as instructions change, so check back here if stated in the release notes.

# Coming Soon
- Plugin support (.dll?)
