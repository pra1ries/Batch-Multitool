A small multitool created in batch.

⚠️ **This project has been archived and will no longer be updated.** ⚠️



NOTE:

Certain functions *WILL NOT WORK* in the "Downloads" folder, please move the file to a different folder once it is downloaded (i.e. Desktop)


This multitool is written entirely in batch, meaning no extra installations are required for installation on Windows.

# How do I use this?
When you launch the program, you will see several different commands. Each one is listed with a number next to it. Type the number of the selected command and press enter to run it. Make sure to make an issue on the issues page if you have trouble with this.

# Installation
1.) Go to https://github.com/CorbinMakesStuff/Batch-Multitool/releases/latest and install "corbinsmultitool.bat"

2.) Dismiss Windows Smartscreen warning. This happens because the file is not commonly downloaded and the program is not signed.

3.) Run the file.

4.) Dismiss Windows Smartscreen again.

5.) Done!

This guide will be updates as instructions change, so check back here if stated in the release notes.

# Plugin support!
Plugin support has been added in v5!

*How do I use it?*

To use a plugin, enter the name of the plugin instead of a command number. For example if the file name is "helloworld.bat" enter "helloworld" to run the plugin.

To make a plugin, program any .bat file and drop it in the plugins folder, it can now be used as a command!
